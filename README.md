### Updates

I'm will gradually adding new structures to the datapack, and i will try to keep updating it to the latest minecraft versions.

### Old Versions

I will only update MinGen to versions after 1.20.6, support for later versions is not considered.

### Issues

I'm not profesional datapack developer, so my datapacks might have bugs and errors.
Please report all issues on the github [page](https://github.com/nederliver/MinGen/issues).
